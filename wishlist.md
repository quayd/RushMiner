# Wishlist and Improvements for RushMiner

## Intended Additions
* API for remote queries
* Native voltage control
* Remote live command line: send "--ftdi-cmd=..." with scripting to a live running instance of RushMiner using standard utilities. 
* Stats on individual cores.
* Hotkey to set specific clock value.
  
## Intended Improvements
* Documentation of usage and views.
* Cleaner layout of stats.
* Auto-adjust settings to maintain temperature and/or error rate.
* Run "--ftdi-cmd" on limit: ex. `--ftdi-cmd="--max-temp-action ramp 0

## Intended Fixes
* Disconnect handling.
* With a large device count 20+(?) hotkeys can get very slow to respond.
